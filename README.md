# Weather-classification

## Introduction
This repository contains our work for a weather image classification project, where we aim to build a deep learning model capable of recognizing weather conditions from images. Throughout the project, we perform data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and multiple modeling attempts using CNN-based models.
